# Motivation

- Recent work: priors on sparse / scale-free graphs
- Can this be extended to modeling communities?

# Motivation
* Impossible to model sparse exchangeable graphs via exchangeable adjacency matrices.

# Recent development
* View a network as an exchangeable point process.
* A point process $Z = \sum_{i, j} z_{ij} \delta_{\theta_{i}, \theta_{j}}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2}_{+}$ is called 
jointly exchangeable if 
$$Z \left(A_{i} \times A_{j} \right) \overset{\mathcal{L}}{=} Z \left(A_{\pi \left( i\right)} \times A_{\pi \left(j\right)}\right) \label{eq:measure_exchangeability}. $$
* Possible to sample, and can lead to sparse graphs.

# Model of Fox and Caron

$$
  W \sim CRM \left(\rho, \lambda\right) \\
  D = \text{PoissonProcess}\left(W \times W \right) = \sum_{i, j} n_{ij} \delta_{\theta_{i}, \theta_{j}}\\
  Z = \text{Capped}\left(\text{Symmetrized}\left(D\right) \right) = 
  \sum_{i, j} \left[\left(n_{ij} + n_{ji}\right) \wedge 1 \right] \delta_{\theta_{i}, \theta_{j}}
$$
where $\rho$ is a Levy intensity and $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$.
In practice, we have to restrict to $\lambda_{\alpha}$.

# Properties

* $Z$ is jointly exchangeable.
* It is possible to sample this model exactly, for appropriate
  choices of $W$.
* When $W$ is chosen to be an NGGP, the proportion of nodes in $D_{\alpha}$ with $j$ total outgoing or ingoing edges -- with self-loops counting twice -- tends to
$$
  \frac{N_{\alpha, j}}{N_{\alpha}} \xrightarrow{\alpha \to \infty} p_{\sigma_{j}} = 
  \frac{\sigma \Gamma \left(j - \sigma\right)}{\Gamma \left(1 - \sigma \right) \Gamma \left(j + 1\right)},
$$
This implies $D$ has an approximately power-law degree distribution
for large $j$, and (after some work) that the network $Z$ 
is sparse in the limit.

# Proposal: Modeling communities

Draw $W = \sum_{i} w_{i} \delta_{\theta_{i}} \sim \text{CRM} \left(\rho, \lambda\right)$. 
For every $\theta_{i} \in \text{supp}\left(W\right)$, draw 

$$
  p_{\theta_{i}} \overset{iid}{\sim} GEM \left(\beta\right),
$$

a stick-breaking process with parameter $\beta$. 

```{r stick_break, fig.height = 3.5}
p <- SampleSB(4, 5, 15)
ggplot(melt(p), aes(x = Var2, y = value, color = as.factor(Var1))) + geom_line()
```

---
Draw $(a_{ij})_{(i,j) \in \mathbb{N}^{2}} \overset{iid}{\sim}$
Beta$(\gamma, \delta)$, representing associations between communities.
For example, an interesting case would be if $A$ is block diagonal.
 Define a "node affinity function,"

$$
H_{A}\left(p_{\theta_{i}}, p_{\theta_{j}}\right) = p_{\theta_{i}}^{T} A p_{\theta_{j}}.
$$

Define networks by
$$
\newcommand{\W}{\tilde{W}}
\newcommand{\D}{\tilde{D}}
\newcommand{\Z}{\tilde{Z}}
  \W = \sum_{i, j}  H_{A}\left(p_{\theta_{i}}, p_{\theta_{j}}\right) w_{i}w_{j} \delta_{\theta_{i}, \theta_{j}} \\
  \D \sim \text{PoissonProcess}\left(\W\right) \\
  \Z = \text{Capped}\left(\text{Symmetrized}\left(\D\right)\right).
$$

This scheme is implemented in the *MMGraph()* function.

Alternatively, we could consider a "hard clustering" for each $\theta_{i}$.

# Properties
* $\D$ is jointly exchangeable.
* $\D$ is a thinning of $D$.
* Can be sampled approximately.
* Still sparse asymptotically.

---
There are a few obvious omissions... 
* A number of interesting quantities about the behavior of the sampler with communities
   are well characterized, either theoretically or experimentally.
* There is no application to data, or even a discussion of how to sample from the posterior 
  for any of these models.
* A clear interpretation or characterization of joint exchangeability of networks / 
  measures has not been described.
